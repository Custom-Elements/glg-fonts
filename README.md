#Overview
**FontAwesome**, **Grotesk**, and **Anonymous Pro** all packed up and
ready to go. No need to even think about it, just put this high in your
root page and let it cascade.

##Usage
This is provided as npm since it has a build step using
[gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

```shell
npm install --save custom-elements/glg-fonts.git
```

In your less source, you just import and this will inline:

```css
@import "<root>/node_modules/glg-fonts/build/glg";
```

##Important
Grotesk will require you to purchase a license to use on sites other
than GLG licensed domains. Don't be a stealer.
